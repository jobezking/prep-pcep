List = collection of elements i.e. numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
index: value inside the brackets which selects one element of list
indexing: operation of selecting an element from list

2D array: create with
two_d_array = [[EMPTY for i in range[7] for j in range[7]]
tuple: a_tuple=(1,2,3,4,5) #immutable
