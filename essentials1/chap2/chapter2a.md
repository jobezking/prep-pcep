### Chapter 2 Notes Continued
Variables: name and value. Used to assign/store results. Defined by assigning value to it
Names - variables and functions - can contain:
1. upper or lowercase letters
2. digits
3. underscore
4. name must begin with letter, which Python regards underscore as for this purpose
5. Python is case-sensitive
6. Cannot be reserved words or reserved keywords
7. Cannot have spaces
8. Can use letters from other alphabets
Comment: remark inserted into program that is omitted at runtime
Responsible developers describe each important piece of code.
Variable and function names should be self_commenting. DO not use variable names that are confusing.
Do not use comments that contain wrong or incorrect information
Comments are important when you are reading your own code and when others read your code.
Input function: switches console to input mode. An argument with the input function sends the content to the screen as text.
The input function returns a string. 
Data can be transformed from one type to another by type casting
string * integer multiplies the string. string + string concatenates the string
