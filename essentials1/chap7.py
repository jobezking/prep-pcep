Rules for variables
0. No restrictions on alphabetic characters. Python treats underscore (_) as an alphabetic character
1. No special characters (again, note that Python treats underscore as alphabetic character)
2. cannot contain spaces but - though it is horrible practice - can begin with them
3. can contain numbers but cannot begin with them
4. case sensitive 

Shortcut operations with variables
take any operation:
variable equals variable and operator and expression
turn it into 
variable operator = expression by "dropping" the variable on the other side of the equation
i.e. x = x + 2 becomes x += 2
y = x * y - c  becomes y *= x - c
