### Chapter 1 Notes
Computers can only execute simple operations. It cannot understand the value of a complicated mathematical function by itself. A computer can only evaluate the results of fundamental operations like adding and dividing, but can do so very fast virtually any number of times. 
Computers need programs. 
Programs need to be in languages that comptuers can understand.
Language: means and tool for expressing and recording thoughts. 
Machine language: rudimentary computer language (developed by humans)
instruction list: complete known set of commands, also called IL. Size of computer instruction lists vary, and the instructions themselves vary.
Natural languages: developed naturally, still evolving with words created and disappearing, human languages are examples.
