#Errors
'''
ValueError - Used when a value is of the incorrect type. For instance, it can be used when a value entered by the user needs to be converted into an integer, 
    but the user has entered an incompatible string.
ZeroDivisionError - This error is triggered when trying to divide zero, which is impossible. 
ImportError - This error is triggered when Python has been instructed to import a module, but the module cannot be found or otherwise cannot be imported successfully. 
IOError - This Input/Output error notification occurs when an I/O operation cannot complete. 
    For instance, this error would trigger when an open() command is called, but the provided file cannot be found.
Index Error - This IndexError occurs when a provided sequence index is out of the range of the sequence that has been provided.
KeyError - This error is triggered when a dictionary key is provided, but the provided key does not exist or can't be found within the dictionary.
TypeError - This error occurs when some function or operation has been applied to a data type but the operation cannot be carried out successfully. 
NameError - This occurs when a designated variable name isn't found.
